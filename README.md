## 📖 About the Project

*Bike-Vista* is a complete Power BI analytics project focused on analyzing global bicycle sales.  
It simulates a **global manufacturing company** that produces cycling equipment and accessories.  

The goal is to build an interactive BI solution that enables users to:
- Track **key performance indicators (KPIs)** such as sales, revenue, profit, and returns  
- Compare **regional performance**  
- Analyze **product-level trends**  
- Identify **high-value customers**

The project is built using a **MySQL relational database** as the primary data source, connected through **dynamic connection parameters** for flexible and secure access.  
It includes **desktop, mobile, and service versions** of Power BI reports, and implements **Row-Level Security (RLS)** and **Object-Level Security (OLS)** to protect sensitive data.  

The solution follows a **professional BI lifecycle** with three dedicated Power BI workspaces:
- **Development** – used for building, modeling, and testing new datasets, reports, and **Dataflows**.  
- **Test** – used for validating datasets, transformations, and dashboard performance before production release.  
- **Production** – used for publishing and maintaining the final dashboards and datasets. In this environment, the final **Power BI Dashboard** and a corresponding **Power BI App** are created and shared with end users.  

A **Power BI Deployment Pipeline** automates the migration between environments (Dev → Test → Prod), ensuring version control, governance, and data consistency.  

The entire project is **hosted on GitHub**, following a **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** workflow to manage version control and automate updates to Power BI Service.

## 🧱 Project Architecture

### 1. Data Source Layer
- **Technology:** MySQL Relational Database  
- Contains structured data for customers, products, sales, and returns  
- Connection established using **dynamic connection parameters** for environment flexibility  

### 2. Data Preparation Layer (Power BI Service – Dataflows)
- Data extracted from MySQL into **Power BI Dataflows**  
- Each **Dataflow** handles transformation, cleaning, and standardization using Power Query (M language)  
- Follows a **star schema** design for optimized reporting performance  
- Shared across environments for **reusability and consistency**  

### 3. Data Modeling and Visualization (Power BI Desktop)
- Power BI Desktop used for data modeling, relationships, and DAX calculations  
- Visual dashboards created for both **desktop and mobile** experiences  
- Published to Power BI Service for centralized access  

### 4. Security and Governance
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** restricts data visibility by user roles and regions  
- **Object-Level Security (OLS)** hides specific tables or fields from unauthorized users  
- Consistent governance with clear naming conventions and role-based permissions  

### 5. Deployment and Environment Management
- The project is structured into three environments:  
  - **Development** – creation and testing of reports and Dataflows  
  - **Test** – validation of models and performance tuning  
  - **Production** – final publication and app deployment for business users  
- Automated migration between environments using **Power BI Deployment Pipelines**  

### 6. Version Control and CI/CD
- Source files, SQL scripts, and documentation are **hosted on GitHub**  
- **CI/CD workflow** automates version control and deployment to Power BI Service  
- Ensures consistent synchronization between environments  

### 7. End-User Experience
- End users access the solution through the **Power BI App** in the Service environment  
- Reports optimized for **desktop, mobile, and service** versions for seamless experience
